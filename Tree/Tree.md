Project Name : Tree

Descrption : Tree projects consists of basic operation to traverse all the BST (Binary Search Tree)/ Binary Tree contents and other below features:

  1) Pre Order Traversal (root -> left - > right)
  2) Post Order Traversal (left -> right -> root)
  3) In Order Traversal (left -> root -> right)
  4) Level Order Traversal (root -> child Nodes)
  5) Zig Zag Level Order Traversal - At every level, sequencing of nodes at level should change to left->right OR right->left (Look for the code output for better understanding)

Would love the feedback from anyone who is looking at the code and think some other ways to optimize the performance of algorithm either in terms of time complexity or space complexity.

You can reach out to me @ v.cse59@gmail.com for further discussion.
